# Smite random generator for JavaScript
Smite builder is my STG-Lib Java library rewritten in JavaScript.
It is capable of generating random gods with random builds for the Hi-Rez studios game, Smite.

## Installation
`npm install smite-builder` or `yarn add smite-builder`

Include it in your project like any other module.

### ES6
```js
import SmiteBuilder from 'smite-builder';
const builder = new SmiteBuilder();
```

### CommonJS
```js
const SmiteBuilder = require('smite-builder');
const builder = new SmiteBuilder();
```

## Usage
Before you can use the module, you'll need to tell it to fetch the latest lists. You can use the promise API or async/await.

```js
builder.getLists().then(() => {});
```
or
```js
async function foo() {
    await builder.getLists();
}
```

Keep in mind that without running the getLists function once, the module will have nothing to generate from.

For specific usage instructions, ~~please consult the documentation~~ (coming soon).
